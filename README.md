TrainBoard

TrainBoard is an HTML/Javascript dashboard which provides an overview of the three most recent deposits, withdrawals and goals made at Betterment. A Java Dashboard controller continually updates an XML file, which is then parsed into TrainData.php and fed to display on index.php.  The style of TrainBoard is designed to mimic the split-flap display of most train station departure boards.
